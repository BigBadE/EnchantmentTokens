CONFIGURATION GUIDE:

COUNTRY-LANGUAGE:

This is the country used for Internalization. If no supported language files are found, this defaults to US.

Supported: US

If your language of choice is not supported, you can create a translation at https://github.com/BigBadE/EnchantmentTokensLocalization.

CURRENCY METHOD:

There are a multitude of ways EnchantmentTokens handles currency.
Currently you can use:
"gems", "vault", and "experience".

There are currently 2 methods of gem saving, persistent data and flat file.
Persistent data is only available for 1.14+.
Flat file saves all data to a separate file in the data folder.
MongoDB Support (https://github.com/BigBadE/EnchantmentTokensMongo/releases) and MySQL (https://github.com/BigBadE/EnchantmentTokensMySQL/releases)
support can be added, by dragging the jar into the "storage" folder.

AUTOSAVE TIME:

If you are using gems, player gem count will be automatically saved after this amount of minutes.

VANILLA ENCHANTMENTS:

There will be no vanilla enchantments added by default. To add a vanilla enchantment, add it to the default configuration.
Here are the current enchantments (as of 1.14.4/1.15.1)
(Versions are included in enchantments added after 1.7, do not use enchantments before they were added):
All: Binding Curse (1.11), Vanishing Curse (1.11), Unbreaking, Mending (1.9)
Armor: Protection, Fire Protection, Feather Falling, Blast Protection, Projectile Projection, Thorns
Helmet: Respiration, Aqua Affinity,
Boots: Depth Strider (1.8), Frost Walker (1.9)
Swords: Sharpness, Smite, Bane Of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping (1.9)
Tools: Efficiency, Silk Touch, Fortune
Bows/Crossbows: Power, Punch, Flame, Infinity
Crossbows Only (1.14): Multishot, Quick Charge, Piercing
Fishing Rods: Luck of The Sea, Lure
Trident (1.13): Loyalty, Impaling, Channeling, Riptide
Shield (1.9): Custom only

Run the server then start it after it boots up, and a simple configuration for each enchantment will be generated.
Configuring enchantments is simple, here is an overview:
name: THIS CAN BE USED FOR TRANSLATING NAMES, BUT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR CUSTOM NAMES BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT AFFECT THE LORE ON THE ITEM
icon: The item that shows up when choosing the enchantment in the enchantment GUI. Name should be uppercase with underscores instead of spaces.
(Some items have different names in-game then in the code, check Minecraft gamepedia for the correct name, under Data Values and Namespaced ID.
price: This section controls the pricing of the enchantment.
type:
"custom": define the price of each level
"linear": define a linear increase in price

CUSTOM ENCHANTMENTS:

Custom enchantments have all the values as Vanilla Enchantments. They also have an enabled setting, so if for instance you get a pack of
enchantments you can remove ones that you don't want by setting enabled to "false".
You can also set "name", the in-game name of the enchantment. The default value is set by the developer.
Custom enchantments might have custom values generated, you can find the use of them on however you downloaded the jar.

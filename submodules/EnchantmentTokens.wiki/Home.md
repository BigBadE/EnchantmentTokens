Welcome to the EnchantmentTokens wiki!

This Wiki will be a guide for not only developers, but server owners too.

[Click here for the guide for developers](Developing.md)

The rest of this guide is for server owners.

Vanilla enchantments:

You can add any of the vanilla enchantments from configurationguide.txt to the list.

Run the server once so the configuration can update, and all the vanilla enchantments will be generated.

Custom enchantments:

Download any jar, and put it in the "enchantments" folder.

A configuration will be automatically generated on the next startup.

Refer to configurationguide.txt for the rest of the options.
